# leetcode_365_Days_Challenge
I personally love challenges. They motivate me. They’re set for a predefined period of time. It becomes a thing you must do each day since you’re on the goal to complete it. If you miss one day, you have to restart, which is why most people never complete it when they miss a day.  I’ve already started a 365 day writing challenge where I’m writing an article each day for 365 days.
